# FriendFinder

Week 13 at The Coding Boot Camp @ UNC Chapel Hill learning Express. This app uses is storing user responses in a js file (breaking will reset data). MySQL was not used as it was not a requirement per this exercise's instructions. Responses are posted to the js file, but before it is pushed a least difference algorithm is applied to return the index of a user with the least difference based on their answers.
